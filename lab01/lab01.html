<h1>Van Helsing</h1>
<hr></hr>
<p>Van Helsing is a 2004 action gothic horror film written and directed by Stephen Sommers. 
    It stars Hugh Jackman as monster hunter Van Helsing, and Kate Beckinsale as Anna Valerious. 
    The film is a homage and tribute to the Universal Horror Monster films from the 1930s and 1940s 
    (also produced by Universal Studios which were in turn partially based on novels by Bram Stoker and Mary Shelley), 
    of which Sommers is a fan.</p>

<p>The eponymous character was inspired by the Dutch vampire hunter Abraham Van Helsing from Irish author Bram Stoker's novel Dracula. 
    Distributed by Universal Pictures, the film includes a number of monsters such as Count Dracula (and other vampires), Frankenstein's monster, 
    Duergar, Mr. Hyde and werewolves in a way similar to the multi-monster movies that Universal produced in the 1940s, such as Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man, 
    House of Frankenstein and House of Dracula. The film received mostly negative reviews but has grossed $300 million worldwide.</p>
